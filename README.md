This repo contains my homeworks for Trustworthy AI course. Contents and description of homeworks are as follows:
- HW#1 : In this assignment, we aimed to robustify models against attacks (FGSM and PGD) and also test and improve the generalization of a model trained on the SVHN dataset to the MNIST dataset.
- HW#2 :  The second homework focused on explainability. This was practiced on tabular datasets using techniques such as LIME, Shapley values, and GRACE.
   For visual explanations, I utilized methods like GradCAM, guided backpropagation, SmoothGrad, and activation maximization.
- HW#3 : This assignment is about causal discovery and bayesian networks. This Homework has no submitted code.
- HW#4 : The final homework explored the security of models, focusing on mitigating backdoor attacks using appropriate data.
   Additionally, model fairness was assessed using the Zemel fairness model and disparate impact metrics, with attempts to improve the fairness of the model based on these evaluations
